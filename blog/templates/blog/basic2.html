        <h2>"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"</h2>
        <h4>- First principle of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h4>
        <p>It's such a simple concept, really - and if it needed explaining at all, the authors themselves wrote: <i>"while there is value in the items on
        the right</i> (processes and tools)<i>, we value the items on the left </i>(individuals and interactions)<i> more"</i>.</p>
        <p>However, if anything, the processes and tools that surround how we build software have grown over time, often at the expense of individuals and to the detriment of interactions.</p>
        <h3>My God, how did we get here?</h3>
        <p>I believe that the manifesto is fundamentally right - we should be valuing 'individuals and interactions' (or 'people and communication' if you prefer).</p>
        <p>However, fear of weakness, of saying 'I don't know', especially in what has been a male-dominated profession has led us to use these processes and tools as a form of defence, as a fig leaves to cover our lack of certainty and our vulnerability.</p>
        <p>"How's the sprint going?"</p>
        <p>"Look at this burndown chart and see for yourself!"</p>
        <p>Not that measurement in itself is a bad thing - far from it. It just that oftentimes, it gives a false sense of confidence.</p>
        <h3>So, what do we do?</h3>
        <p>I haven't got all the answers but I won't pretend that I do.</p>
        <p>From playing team sports all my life and studying psychology, I have a huge interest in what it takes to build and sustain a high-performing team.</p>
        <p>If you share this interest, please feel free to explore the articles that I have written on the site and get in touch.</p>
