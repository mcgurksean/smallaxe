              <h1>“The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of a doubt, what is laid before him.”</h1>
              <p>Leo Tolstoy, The Kingdom of Heaven is Within You</p>
              <h2>"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"</h2>
              <h4>- First principle of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h4>
              <p>It's such a simple concept, really - and if it needed explaining at all, the authors themselves wrote: <i>"while there is value in the items on
              the right</i> (processes and tools)<i>, we value the items on the left </i>(individuals and interactions)<i> more"</i>.</p>
              <p>However, if anything, the processes and tools that surround how we build software have grown over time, often at the expense of individuals and to the detriment of interactions.</p>
              <h3>How did we get here?</h3>
              <p>I believe that the manifesto is fundamentally right - we should be valuing 'individuals and interactions' (or 'people and communication' if you prefer).</p>
              <p>However, fear of weakness, of saying 'I don't know', especially in what has been a male-dominated profession has led us to use these processes and tools as a form of defence, as a fig leaves to cover our lack of certainty and our vulnerability.</p>
              <p>"How's the sprint going?"</p>
              <p>"Look at this burndown chart and see for yourself!"</p>
              <p>Not that measurement in itself is a bad thing - far from it. It just that oftentimes, it gives a false sense of confidence.</p>
              <h3>So, what do we do?</h3>
              <p>I haven't got all the answers but I won't pretend that I do.</p>
              <p>From playing team sports all my life and studying psychology, I have a huge interest in what it takes to build and sustain a high-performing team.</p>
